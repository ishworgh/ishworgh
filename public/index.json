[{"content":"Introduction #A website is simply your page on the internet—a space where you can share what you want, how you want, without any algorithms dictating your content. It\u0026rsquo;s a place for others to explore your work exactly as you present it.\nSince the very beginning of me using internet, I always wanted to have my own website. It has been a long time since comming, but finally I have created one ishworgh.xyz, which I will be using to share my personal achievements, moments and my thoughts.\nBefore proceeding any further, I would like to clarify that building a website using this method required some technical know how.You should have basic understand of web technologies like HTML and CSS, as well as familiarity with tools like GitHub. Prerequisites for building your website #To create your website, you’ll need the following:\nHUGO Github Account A bit of patience (trust me, it\u0026rsquo;s worth it) Setting up the website #HUGO is a static site generator that handles all the heavy lifting, giving you a simple and efficient way to create, modify, and manage your website\u0026rsquo;s content.\nInstalling HUGO #Installing HUGO is straightforward. If your are using Linux like me (you really should be), it is easy as running single command in your terminal.\nFor Arch Linux\nsudo pacman -Syu hugo For other system, you can refer to the official HUGO documentation.\nAfter installing hugo, open your terminal and enter the following command to initialize new hugo site.\nhugo new site *{your-site}* cd *{your-site}* Installing Congo theme #In order to create website using HUGO, you need themes. There are tons of Hugo themes available, so feel free to explore and choose one that suits your style.\nFor my website, I have decided to use Congo theme. It is a popular theme with extensive documentation and a large supportive community. Some other great alternatives included blowfish and papermod.\nExplore more themes at HUGO Themes.\nIn order to install the congo theme, there are mainly two options that I recommend:\nOption 1: Using hugo module #First, ensure you have Go installed:\nsudo pacman -Syu go Then initialize Hugo module and add congo theme:\nhugo mod init github.com/\u0026lt;username\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;repo-name\u0026gt; # managing using github hugo mod init {my-project} # managing locally echo -e \u0026#39;\\n[[imports]]\\npath = \u0026#34;github.com/jpanther/congo/v2\u0026#34;\u0026#39; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; config/_default/module.toml Option 2: Manual Installation #There is a simpler option if you are not comfortable with command line and git. Head to the congo releases page and download the zip file.\nFor more details, please refer to the official Congo Documentation Page. After that, open the hugo directory on your terminal and enter the following command\nhugo server Hugo server started and live at http://localhost:1313/ After hugo server is started, your local hugo website will be live at http://localhost:1313/.\nCustomizing the theme #The Congo theme has extensive documentation, making it easy to customize the design to fit your preferences. Spend some time exploring the options and tweaking the settings to make the site truly yours.\nHosting \u0026amp; Deploying your website using Github pages #Once your website is ready, you’ll need a place to host it. GitHub Pages is an excellent free option to get started.\nTo get started, head over to github and login.\nCreate a new repository New github repository Upload your hugo directory to github, either by comand line or mannual upload. Github repository after uploading all the files Github has a nice feature through which you can automate the deployment process of the content of your repository through github paged.\nAutomate the deployment process by creating a .github/workflow/ directory on your hugo directory and adding a hugo.yml file with following content: # Sample workflow for building and deploying a Hugo site to GitHub Pages name: Deploy Hugo site to Pages on: # Runs on pushes targeting the default branch push: branches: [\u0026#34;main\u0026#34;] # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab workflow_dispatch: # Sets permissions of the GITHUB_TOKEN to allow deployment to GitHub Pages permissions: contents: read pages: write id-token: write # Allow only one concurrent deployment, skipping runs queued between the run in-progress and latest queued. # However, do NOT cancel in-progress runs as we want to allow these production deployments to complete. concurrency: group: \u0026#34;pages\u0026#34; cancel-in-progress: false # Default to bash defaults: run: shell: bash jobs: # Build job build: runs-on: ubuntu-latest env: HUGO_VERSION: 0.145.0 # at the time of writing, due to hugo update congo theme requires this hugo version steps: - name: Install Hugo CLI run: | wget -O ${{ runner.temp }}/hugo.deb https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/download/v${HUGO_VERSION}/hugo_extended_${HUGO_VERSION}_linux-amd64.deb \\ \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sudo dpkg -i ${{ runner.temp }}/hugo.deb - name: Install Dart Sass run: sudo snap install dart-sass - name: Checkout uses: actions/checkout@v4 with: submodules: recursive - name: Setup Pages id: pages uses: actions/configure-pages@v5 - name: Install Node.js dependencies run: \u0026#34;[[ -f package-lock.json || -f npm-shrinkwrap.json ]] \u0026amp;\u0026amp; npm ci || true\u0026#34; - name: Build with Hugo env: HUGO_CACHEDIR: ${{ runner.temp }}/hugo_cache HUGO_ENVIRONMENT: production run: | hugo \\ --minify \\ --baseURL \u0026#34;${{ steps.pages.outputs.base_url }}/\u0026#34; - name: Upload artifact uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3 with: path: ./public # Deployment job deploy: environment: name: github-pages url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }} runs-on: ubuntu-latest needs: build steps: - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages id: deployment uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4 Push the changes to github, and voila your website will be ready to be excessed by anyone throught the world. If you don\u0026rsquo;t have time or don\u0026rsquo;t want any hassle, and need a base to get started, you can head over to my github repository, clone it and modify/customize per your liking, then upload it to github.\nConclusion #Creating a website with Hugo and the Congo theme has been an exciting journey for me, and I hope this guide helps you kickstart your own project.
